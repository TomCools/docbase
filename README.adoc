## Asciidoc Example

Generating the documentation PDF: Run `mvn process-resources`
Resulting files are in the /target folder.

Publish the documentation to confluence: Run `mvn asciidoc-confluence-publisher:publish`
Do check the setting in the POM.xml :-)

### Recommendation

If you want to document in the Arc42 style, there is a repository which already contains the structure.
You can copy that into your own repository: https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template
